Inspect the file `devprompts/highlevel-requirements.md`.

Determine the required Spring MVC Endpoints required to implement the described functionality. Inspect the project. 
Develop the directions required to implement the endpoints. 

The directions should include the following:
- adding the controller called `InteractionController`
- adding a service layer in the pacakage `services` called `InteractionService`, provide an interface and a default implementation.
  All business logic should be implemented in the default implementation of the service.
- The controller should call the service to perform the required business logic.
- Add tests for the controller and service. Use SpringMVC and Mockito for the controller tests.
- Create an integration test that calls the controller and H2 database and verifies the expected result.

Write the directions to the file `devprompts/4-controller-plan.md`.
